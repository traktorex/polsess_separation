# Baseline Experiment: SPMamba on SB Task
#
# Purpose: Establish baseline performance for SPMamba
# Runs: 3 (seeds: 42, 123, 456)
# Epochs: 30 (very slow training, ~60 min/epoch)
# Architecture: Reduced (memory-constrained, not paper spec)
# NOTE: Using reduced architecture for 12GB GPU compatibility

program: train_sweep.py
method: grid
